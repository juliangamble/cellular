(defn simulate
"Create a matrix of qXq processor nodes.
Every node is connected to its nearest neighbors (if any)
by four communication channels named north, south, east, and west.
Each processor node is responsible for a subgrid of mXm data cells
within the complete nXn grid, where n = q * m
(m must be even because we did not bother to code for the odd case.)
After initializing its subgrid, each node will update the subgrid
and output its successive values.
The nodes will update their subgrids simultaneously.
The full grid for each step is assembled by the master process
and sent to the out channel.
In numerical analysis, grid iteration is known as relaxation.

The nXn data grid is surrounded by a row of boundary cells on each side.
The application object must specify:
    a fixed value for the elements of each boundary
    and an initial value for the interior elements;
    and a transition function that returns the next value for a cell
    given the subgrid and the cell's position in the subgrid.

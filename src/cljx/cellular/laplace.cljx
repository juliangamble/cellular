(defn transitioner
  "In steady state, the temperature of every interior cell
is the average of the neighboring temperatures. This is the
discrete form of Laplace's equation. The residual is a measure
of how close the temperatures are to satisfying this equation.
The correction of a temperature is proportional to its residual.

For a large square grid relaxed in parity order, the relaxation factor
    fopt = 2 - 2*pi/n
ensures the fastest possible convergence towards stationary temperatures.
In numerical analysis, this method is called successive overrelaxation
with parity ordering."
